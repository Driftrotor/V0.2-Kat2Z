# V0.2 Kat2Z
A Modified version of G2Z with added Kat for fun!

I love G2Z and wanted one for a long time
but i have a problem with modding things lol
this lead me to make a more compact motor mounting solution to fit it within the stock bottom panel

after that i modified the top tensioner to add a few extra features
- carrier now has slides to keep it in place
- cute Kat face for... well... Katz!

i big thank you to HartK for making this even possible by making G2Z
